---

## ✅ EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### After Phase 2 Completes
- ✅ All 17,969 existing embeddings regenerated from enriched data
- ✅ No embeddings using raw resume_text
- ✅ Search quality improved (embeddings use structured data)
- ✅ metadata.source = 'reembed_migration'
- ⚠️ Still missing 11,173 candidates (but existing search improved)

### Production Impact
- **Search still works** during re-embedding
- Embeddings updated incrementally (batch of 10)
- Users can test with existing 28,527 embeddings
- Quality improves as re-embedding progresses

---

## 📈 PROGRESS TRACKING

### Monitoring Commands

**Check if re-embedding is still running:**
```bash
ps aux | grep reembed_enriched_candidates
```

**View progress (once progress file exists):**
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
try:
    with open('data/enriched/reembed_progress.json', 'r') as f:
        progress = json.load(f)
        total = progress.get('total', 17969)
        completed = progress.get('completed', 0)
        percent = (completed / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0
        print(f'Re-embedding progress: {completed:,}/{total:,} ({percent:.1f}%)')
        print(f'Last updated: {progress.get(\"last_updated\", \"N/A\")}')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print('Progress file not yet created')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Error reading progress: {e}')
"
```

**Check Firestore count (verify no deletions):**
```bash
python3 -c "
from google.cloud import firestore
db = firestore.Client(project='headhunter-ai-0088')
count = sum(1 for _ in db.collection('tenants/tenant-alpha/candidates').stream())
print(f'Firestore candidates: {count:,}')
print(f'Expected: 17,969')
"
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- ✅ All 17,969 candidates re-embedded
- ✅ Failures < 5% (acceptable threshold)
- ✅ metadata.source updated in Cloud SQL
- ✅ Search quality tests pass

### Search Quality Test:
```bash
# Test with diverse queries to verify improved results
# Should see better matches after re-embedding completes
```

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: Missing 11,173 Candidates
**Status:** Not yet addressed
**Impact:** Search coverage at 61.7% instead of 100%
**Solution:** Will address after Phase 2 completes
**Workflow needed:**
1. Upload candidates to Firestore (as raw profiles)
2. Trigger enrichment service for each
3. Embeddings auto-generate after enrichment

### Issue 2: Re-embedding Script API Endpoint
**Status:** Using correct script (`reembed_enriched_candidates.py`)
**Previous issue:** Parallel script had wrong endpoint
**Solution:** Using direct re-embedding script instead

### Issue 3: 423 Quarantined Candidates
**Status:** Will investigate after Phase 2
**Action:** Analyze failure reasons, retry or document exclusions

---

## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Re-embedding Stops/Fails

1. **Check if process is still running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep reembed
   ```

2. **Check for errors:**
   ```bash
   cat data/enriched/reembed_failed.json | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

3. **Resume if needed:**
   - Script saves progress automatically
   - Can restart - will skip already processed

4. **Check API health:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://hh-embed-svc-production-akcoqbr7sa-uc.a.run.app/health
   ```

### Common Issues

**High failure rate (>10%)**
- Check API rate limits
- Verify authentication token valid
- Check Cloud Run service health

**Slow progress**
- Normal rate: ~180-200 candidates/hour
- If slower: Check network, API latency

**Out of memory error**
- Script processes in small batches (10)
- Should not cause memory issues
- If occurs: Check system resources

## 🎉 WHAT'S NEXT

### When Phase 2 Completes:
1. ✅ Verify final counts and quality
2. ✅ Run search quality tests
3. ✅ Update this status document
4. 🎯 **Decision point:** Address missing 11,173 candidates or start user testing

### User Testing Readiness

**Can start testing NOW:**
- ✅ Production search operational (961ms p95)
- ⚠️ 61.7% coverage (17,969/29,142)
- 🔄 Quality improving as re-embedding progresses

**After Phase 2:**

## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY (2025-10-27 17:00 UTC)

**Schema Mismatch Blocking Re-embedding**

### Issue
The re-embedding script `reembed_enriched_candidates.py` completed but skipped ALL 17,969 candidates with "No searchable profile could be built".

### Root Cause
The Firestore enriched candidates use a **completely different schema** than what the re-embedding script expects:

**Firestore Actual Schema:**
```
intelligent_analysis:
  inferred_skills (list)
  explicit_skills (list)
  role_based_competencies (dict)
  career_trajectory_analysis (dict)
  company_context_skills (list)
  composite_skill_profile (dict)
  market_positioning (str)
  recruiter_insights (dict)

Top-level fields:
  primary_expertise (list)
  current_level (str)
  search_keywords (str)
  inferred_skills_high_confidence (list)
  explicit_skills (list)
  all_probable_skills (list)
```

**Script Expects (TypeScript hh-enrich-svc schema):**
```
technical_assessment.primary_skills
skill_assessment.technical_skills.core_competencies
experience_analysis.current_role
career_trajectory.current_level
leadership_scope.has_leadership
company_pedigree.company_tier
recruiter_recommendations.ideal_roles
```

### Impact
- ❌ Cannot re-embed enriched candidates without schema alignment
- ❌ Re-embedding script needs to be updated to match actual Firestore schema
- ⚠️ Alternative: Re-enrich all candidates using hh-enrich-svc to get correct schema

### Options

**Option 1: Update Re-embedding Script** (RECOMMENDED - FASTEST)
- Modify `scripts/reembed_enriched_candidates.py` to read from `intelligent_analysis` schema
- Map existing fields to searchable profile format
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours to update + 2-3 hours to run
- Cost: ~$2 (embeddings only)

**Option 2: Re-enrich All Candidates**
- Use hh-enrich-svc to re-process all 17,969 candidates
- Will generate correct schema expected by TypeScript services
- Estimated time: 6-8 hours
- Cost: ~$36 (Together AI + embeddings)
- Risk: May lose existing enrichment data

**Option 3: Schema Migration Script**
- Transform existing Firestore data from old schema to new schema
- Requires careful field mapping
- Est estimated time: 2-3 hours to implement + 1 hour to run
- Cost: $0 (no API calls)
- Risk: Data transformation errors

### Recommendation
**Option 1** - Update the re-embedding script to work with the actual Firestore schema. This is the fastest path to getting embeddings generated from enriched data, and avoids re-processing costs.

### Next Steps
1. Update `scripts/reembed_enriched_candidates.py` `buildSearchableProfile()` function
2. Map Firestore fields to searchable profile:
   - `intelligent_analysis.explicit_skills` → Technical Skills
   - `primary_expertise` → Domain Expertise
   - `current_level` → Seniority
   - `intelligent_analysis.recruiter_insights` → Best Fit Roles
   - `search_keywords` → Keywords
3. Test with small batch (10-20 candidates)
4. Run full re-embedding

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27 17:00 UTC
**Critical Blocker:** Schema mismatch between Firestore data and re-embedding script
**Next Action:** Update re-embedding script to match actual Firestore schema
