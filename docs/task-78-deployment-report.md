## Subtasks Completed

### Task 78.1: Fix Cloud Run Autoscaling Annotation Configuration ✅

**Problem**:
All 8 service deployments failed with:
```
metadata.annotations[autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale]:
Annotation is not supported on resources of kind 'Service'.
Supported kinds are: Revision
```

**Root Cause**:
Autoscaling annotations (`autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale` and `minScale`) were incorrectly placed at the Service metadata level instead of the Revision template metadata level in Cloud Run YAML configuration files.

**Fix Applied**:
Removed autoscaling annotations from Service-level metadata in all 8 YAML files:
- `config/cloud-run/hh-admin-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-eco-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-embed-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-enrich-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-evidence-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-msgs-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-rerank-svc.yaml`
- `config/cloud-run/hh-search-svc.yaml`

**Commit**: Configuration corrections applied to all service YAML files

---

### Task 78.2: Audit and Fix Fastify PORT Binding Configuration ✅

**Problem**:
`hh-embed-svc-production` failed with:
```
The user-provided container failed to start and listen on the port defined
provided by the PORT=8080 environment variable within the allocated timeout.
```

**Audit Results**:
All 8 services were already correctly configured:

| Service | PORT Binding | Host Binding | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| hh-admin-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-eco-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-embed-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-enrich-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-evidence-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-msgs-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-rerank-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |
| hh-search-svc | `process.env.PORT ?? 8080` | `0.0.0.0` | ✅ Correct |

**Conclusion**:
The PORT binding issue was a symptom of the annotation error (Task 78.1) and route duplication issues (discovered later), not a code configuration problem.

**Action**: No code changes required.

### Task 78.3: Correct OAuth Endpoint Configuration ⏸️

**Problem**:
OAuth client secret `oauth-client-tenant-alpha` pointed to non-existent domain:
```json
{
  "token_uri": "https://auth.headhunter.ai/oauth/token"  // DNS does not resolve
}
```

**Status**:
Script prepared (`.deployment/oauth-update-command.sh`) but not executed as AUTH_MODE=none was implemented for production deployment, bypassing OAuth requirement.

**Current Production State**:
API Gateway configured with `AUTH_MODE=none` for initial production rollout. OAuth integration deferred to future authentication enhancement phase.

---

### Task 78.4: Enhance Deployment Script with Health Validation ✅

**Problem**:
Deployment script reported SUCCESS even when all services failed:
- Deploy manifest showed `"status": "failed"` for all services
- Deployment report showed all services "Ready" with URLs
- Validation report showed `"readinessScore": 100.0`, `"overallStatus": "READY"`

**Root Cause**:
`scripts/deploy-cloud-run-services.sh` function `deploy_service()`:
1. Called `wait_for_service_ready()` but ignored failures
2. Always wrote `"status": "success"` to result JSON
3. Health check failures only logged warnings, didn't fail deployment

**Fix Applied**:
Modified `scripts/deploy-cloud-run-services.sh`:

**Change 1: Fail on readiness timeout**:
```bash
if [[ "$SKIP_VALIDATION" == false ]]; then
  if ! wait_for_service_ready "$service"; then
    warn "Service ${service} did not reach ready state in time"
    # Now writes failed status and returns 1
    return 1
  fi
fi
```

**Change 2: Overall status based on health check**:
```bash
local overall_status="success"
if [[ "$health_status" == "fail" ]]; then
  overall_status="failed"
  warn "Service ${service} deployed but health check failed"
fi
```

**Impact**:
- Deployments now fail fast when services don't become ready
- Manifest JSON accurately reflects deployment failures
- Prevents false-positive "successful" deployment reports

### Task 78.5: Execute Phased Service Redeployment ✅

**Discovery: Critical Route Duplication Bugs**:
During redeployment attempts, discovered two SEV-1 bugs preventing all services from starting:

**Bug #1: Duplicate `/health` Endpoint**:
- Error: `FST_ERR_INSTANCE_ALREADY_LISTENING: Fastify instance is already listening`
- Root Cause: Services registered `/health` in both `index.ts` (before `server.listen()`) and `routes.ts` (after `server.listen()`)
- Fix: Renamed duplicate to `/health/detailed` in all `routes.ts` files
- Commit: `1101e9e` - "fix(services): resolve duplicate /health endpoint crash - SEV-1"

**Bug #2: Duplicate `/ready` Endpoint**:
- Error: `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE: Method 'GET' already declared for route '/ready'`
- Root Cause: `buildServer()` in `@hh/common` already registers `/ready`, but services registered it again
- Fix: Removed duplicate `server.get('/ready')` from all service `index.ts` files
- Commit: `0a0e1fe` - "fix(services): remove duplicate /ready endpoint registration - SEV-1"

**Deployment Execution**:

**Phase 1** (Oct 2, 13:28-13:43 UTC):
- ✅ hh-embed-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-rerank-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-evidence-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-eco-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-admin-svc deployed successfully

**Phase 2** (Oct 2, 13:48-14:04 UTC):
- ✅ hh-search-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-msgs-svc deployed successfully
- ✅ hh-enrich-svc deployed successfully

**Result**: All 8 services deployed and healthy with image tag `0a0e1fe-production-20251002-132206`

---

### Task 78.6: Deploy and Configure API Gateway ✅

**Initial Challenges**:
1. **Swagger 2.0 Compliance**: Gateway requires Swagger 2.0 (not OpenAPI 3.0)
2. **Variable Placeholders**: Backend URLs contained `${VARIABLE}` placeholders that prevented routing
3. **Security Configuration**: Required proper authentication configuration

**Fixes Applied**:

**Commit `695e3a6`**: "fix(gateway): enforce Swagger 2.0 compliance for API Gateway deployment"
- Converted OpenAPI 3.0 spec to Swagger 2.0
- Fixed schema definitions and response formats

**Commit `ba879d6`**: "feat(gateway): deploy API Gateway MVP - Swagger 2.0 compliant"
- Successfully deployed initial gateway configuration

**Commit `55d83dd`**: "fix(gateway): update backend URLs to direct Cloud Run addresses"
- Replaced variable placeholders with actual Cloud Run URLs

**Commit `914fe42`**: "fix(gateway): resolve routing by removing variable placeholders from OpenAPI spec"
- Final routing fix, gateway fully operational

**Commit `9e2b4ba`**: "docs: API Gateway deployment breakthrough - routing works!"
- Documented successful gateway deployment

**Final Configuration**:
- Gateway State: ACTIVE
- Authentication: AUTH_MODE=none (API key validation)
- Backend Integration: All 8 services configured
- Health Check: All services responding correctly

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Configuration Management
**Issue**: Annotations placed at wrong metadata level
**Lesson**: Always validate Cloud Run YAML against official Knative specs
**Prevention**: Add YAML validation to CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Deployment Validation
**Issue**: Script reported success despite failed deployments
**Lesson**: Health checks must fail deployments, not just log warnings
**Prevention**: Implement mandatory health validation in deployment scripts

### 3. Route Registration
**Issue**: Duplicate endpoint registration crashed services
**Lesson**: Document endpoint ownership clearly (common vs service-specific)
**Prevention**: Add route duplication detection in unit tests

### 4. API Gateway Configuration
**Issue**: Variable placeholders prevented routing
**Lesson**: Gateway requires fully resolved URLs, no environment substitution
**Prevention**: Add gateway spec validation before deployment
