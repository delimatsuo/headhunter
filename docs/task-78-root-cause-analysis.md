# Root Cause Analysis - Task 78 Deployment Failure

**Date**: October 1-2, 2025
**Incident**: Failed production deployment of 8 Fastify services
**Severity**: P0 / SEV-1 (Complete production outage)
**Resolution Time**: 48 hours
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

---

## Executive Summary

The production deployment of the Headhunter AI Fastify service mesh failed completely due to four distinct root causes spanning configuration management, code architecture, deployment automation, and infrastructure integration. This analysis documents each root cause, contributing factors, and systemic improvements to prevent recurrence.

---

## Root Cause #1: Cloud Run Annotation Misconfiguration

### Problem Statement

All 8 Cloud Run service deployments failed immediately with:

```
ERROR: (gcloud.run.services.replace) INVALID_ARGUMENT:
The request has errors
- @type: type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.BadRequest
  fieldViolations:
  - description: Annotation is not supported on resources of kind 'Service'.
                 Supported kinds are: Revision
    field: metadata.annotations[autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale]
```

### Root Cause

Autoscaling annotations (`autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale` and `autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale`) were incorrectly placed at the **Service metadata level** instead of the **Revision template metadata level**.

### Technical Analysis

Cloud Run (based on Knative) has two distinct metadata scopes:
1. **Service metadata**: Applies to the Service resource itself (immutable configuration)
2. **Revision template metadata**: Applies to each revision/deployment (mutable configuration)

Autoscaling annotations MUST be placed on Revision templates because they control runtime behavior that can change between deployments.

**Incorrect Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hh-search-svc-production
  annotations:
    autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "10"  # ❌ WRONG - Service level
    autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"   # ❌ WRONG - Service level
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "10"  # ✅ Also here (duplicate)
```

**Correct Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hh-search-svc-production
  annotations:
    run.googleapis.com/ingress: internal-and-cloud-load-balancing
    # Autoscaling annotations NOT here
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "10"  # ✅ CORRECT - Revision level
        autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"   # ✅ CORRECT - Revision level
```

### Contributing Factors

1. **Configuration Template Copy-Paste**: Initial configuration likely copied from incorrect source or example
2. **Lack of YAML Validation**: No pre-deployment validation against Knative schemas
3. **Environment Variable Substitution**: Variable placeholders like `${SERVICE_MAX_SCALE}` made errors less obvious in source files
4. **No CI/CD Validation**: Missing automated validation step in deployment pipeline

### Affected Services

All 8 services had identical misconfiguration:
- hh-admin-svc
- hh-eco-svc
- hh-embed-svc
- hh-enrich-svc
- hh-evidence-svc
- hh-msgs-svc
- hh-rerank-svc
- hh-search-svc

### Impact

- **Duration**: Blocked all deployments for ~24 hours
- **Severity**: Complete deployment failure, zero services deployable
- **Business Impact**: Prevented production rollout entirely

### Resolution

1. Removed autoscaling annotations from Service-level metadata in all 8 YAML files
2. Verified annotations remained at Revision template level
3. Committed changes to version control
4. Re-attempted deployment (revealed next root cause)

### Prevention Measures

1. **Add YAML Schema Validation**: Implement `kubeval` or Cloud Run YAML validator in CI/CD
2. **Pre-Deployment Dry Run**: Use `gcloud run services replace --dry-run` before actual deployment
3. **Configuration Template Review**: Audit all configuration templates against official Cloud Run documentation
4. **Automated Testing**: Add configuration validation tests to deployment scripts

---

## Root Cause #2: Fastify Duplicate Route Registration (SEV-1)

### Problem Statement

After fixing annotation issues, all services crashed on startup with:

```
[SEARCH] FATAL ERROR in bootstrap: FastifyError [Error]:
Fastify instance is already listening. Cannot add route!
Code: FST_ERR_INSTANCE_ALREADY_LISTENING
```

Followed by second error:

```
FastifyError [Error]: Method 'GET' already declared for route '/ready'
Code: FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE
```

### Root Cause

Two critical bugs in service initialization:

**Bug 2.1: Duplicate `/health` Endpoint**
- Services registered `/health` in `index.ts` BEFORE calling `server.listen()`
- Then attempted to register `/health` AGAIN in `routes.ts` AFTER `server.listen()`
- Fastify throws `FST_ERR_INSTANCE_ALREADY_LISTENING` when routes are added after server starts

**Bug 2.2: Duplicate `/ready` Endpoint**
- Common library `@hh/common` already registered `/ready` in `buildServer()`
- Services redundantly registered `/ready` again in their `index.ts`
- Fastify throws `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE` for duplicate route declarations

### Technical Analysis

**Fastify Route Registration Timing**:
```typescript
// CORRECT ORDER:
const server = buildServer()        // Step 1: Create server
server.register(routes)             // Step 2: Register routes
await server.listen({ port, host }) // Step 3: Start listening

// INCORRECT - WHAT HAPPENED:
const server = buildServer()        // Step 1: Create server
server.get('/health', () => {...})  // Step 2: Register /health
await server.listen({ port, host }) // Step 3: Start listening
// ... later in routes.ts ...
server.get('/health', () => {...})  // ❌ CRASH - server already listening
```

**Common Library Conflict**:
```typescript
// In @hh/common/src/server.ts:
export function buildServer() {
  const server = Fastify()
  server.get('/ready', () => { status: 'ready' }) // Library registers /ready
  return server
}

// In services/hh-search-svc/src/index.ts:
const server = buildServer()
server.get('/ready', () => {...})  // ❌ DUPLICATE - already registered by buildServer
```

### Contributing Factors

1. **Unclear Ownership**: No documentation of which endpoints belong to common vs service-specific code
2. **Code Duplication**: Each service independently implemented health endpoints
3. **Insufficient Unit Tests**: No tests detecting duplicate route registration
4. **Lack of Integration Testing**: Local testing didn't catch the timing issue
5. **Poor Error Messages**: Fastify errors didn't immediately reveal the duplicate route names

### Affected Services

**Bug 2.1 (`/health` duplicate)**: 7 services
- hh-eco-svc
- hh-embed-svc
- hh-enrich-svc
- hh-evidence-svc
- hh-msgs-svc
- hh-rerank-svc
- hh-search-svc

**Bug 2.2 (`/ready` duplicate)**: Same 7 services

**Not Affected**: hh-admin-svc (had different initialization pattern)

### Impact

- **Duration**: 4-6 hours to discover, fix, and redeploy
- **Severity**: SEV-1, complete service crash on startup
- **Business Impact**: Prevented all services from starting
- **Container Restart Loop**: Cloud Run repeatedly tried to start containers, failed health checks

### Resolution

**Fix for Bug 2.1**:
```typescript
// In routes.ts - renamed to avoid conflict
export async function routes(server: FastifyInstance) {
  // Changed from '/health' to '/health/detailed'
  server.get('/health/detailed', async () => {
    return {
      status: 'healthy',
      version: process.env.npm_package_version,
      // ... detailed health info
    }
  })
}
```

**Fix for Bug 2.2**:
```typescript
// In index.ts - removed duplicate registration
const server = buildServer()

// ❌ REMOVED THIS:
// server.get('/ready', async () => ({ status: 'ready' }))

// buildServer() already registered /ready, no duplicate needed
```

**Commits**:
- `1101e9e`: "fix(services): resolve duplicate /health endpoint crash - SEV-1"
- `0a0e1fe`: "fix(services): remove duplicate /ready endpoint registration - SEV-1"

### Prevention Measures

1. **Endpoint Registry Documentation**: Document all common library endpoints in README
2. **Automated Route Detection**: Add tests that detect duplicate route registration
3. **Linting Rules**: Create ESLint rule to flag duplicate route patterns
4. **Integration Tests**: Add tests that verify endpoint registration before server.listen()
5. **Code Review Checklist**: Include "check for duplicate routes" in PR template

## Root Cause #3: Deployment Script False Positive Reporting

### Problem Statement

Deployment script `deploy-cloud-run-services.sh` reported **SUCCESS** even though all services failed to deploy. The deployment manifest showed:

```json
{
  "service": "hh-search-svc",
  "status": "success",  // ❌ FALSE - service actually failed
  "health": "unknown"
}
```

Validation report showed:
```json
{
  "readinessScore": 100.0,    // ❌ FALSE - nothing was ready
  "overallStatus": "READY"    // ❌ FALSE - all services failed
}
```

### Root Cause

The deployment script had multiple flaws in its health validation logic:

**Flaw 3.1: Ignored Health Check Failures**
```bash
# In deploy_service() function:
if [[ "$SKIP_VALIDATION" == false ]]; then
  wait_for_service_ready "$service"  # Called but return value ignored ❌
fi

# Always reported success regardless
cat >"${TMP_RESULTS_DIR}/${service}.json" <<JSON
{
  "status": "success"  # Hardcoded success ❌
}
JSON
```

**Flaw 3.2: Health Check Didn't Fail Deployment**
```bash
function wait_for_service_ready() {
  # ... timeout logic ...
  if [[ "$elapsed" -ge "$max_wait" ]]; then
    warn "Service not ready after ${max_wait}s"  # ❌ Just warning
    return 0  # ❌ Returns success anyway!
  fi
}
```

**Flaw 3.3: Status Always Set to Success**
```bash
# Status field was hardcoded regardless of actual health
local overall_status="success"  # Always success
```

### Technical Analysis

The deployment script had three independent validation mechanisms that all failed:

1. **Readiness Wait**: `wait_for_service_ready()` timed out but didn't propagate failure
2. **Health Check**: `perform_health_check()` logged failures but didn't change deployment status
3. **Result Writing**: Status was hardcoded to "success" instead of using actual validation results

**Correct Flow Should Be**:
```
Deploy Service → Wait for Ready → Check Health → Set Status Based on Results
                       ↓ FAIL           ↓ FAIL
                    return 1         return 1
                       ↓                 ↓
                  status="failed"   status="failed"
```

**What Actually Happened**:
```
Deploy Service → Wait for Ready → Check Health → Set Status = "success"
                       ↓ FAIL           ↓ FAIL
                  (ignored)        (logged warning)
                       ↓                 ↓
                  status="success"  status="success"
```

### Contributing Factors

1. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Return codes from validation functions ignored
2. **Optimistic Defaults**: Default behavior was "assume success" rather than "verify success"
3. **Weak Testing**: Deployment script never tested with actual failures
4. **Missing Assertions**: No assertions that deployment succeeded before marking complete
5. **False Confidence**: Previous successful deployments masked the validation issues

### Impact

- **Duration**: Caused ~12 hours of wasted investigation time
- **Severity**: High - prevented accurate failure diagnosis
- **Diagnostic Difficulty**: Operators saw "success" messages while services were completely failed
- **Business Impact**: Delayed root cause discovery and remediation

### Resolution

**Fix Applied to `deploy-cloud-run-services.sh`**:

**Change 1: Fail deployment on readiness timeout**
```bash
if [[ "$SKIP_VALIDATION" == false ]]; then
  if ! wait_for_service_ready "$service"; then
    warn "Service ${service} did not reach ready state in time"
    cat >"${TMP_RESULTS_DIR}/${service}.json" <<JSON
{
  "service": "${service}",
  "status": "failed",  # ✅ Now correctly reports failure
  "health": "not_ready"
}
JSON
    return 1  # ✅ Propagate failure
  fi
fi
```

**Change 2: Set status based on health check results**
```bash
# Determine overall status based on readiness AND health
local overall_status="success"
if [[ "$health_status" == "fail" ]]; then
  overall_status="failed"  # ✅ Reflect actual health
  warn "Service ${service} deployed but health check failed"
elif [[ "$health_status" == "unknown" && "$SKIP_VALIDATION" == false ]]; then
  overall_status="unknown"  # ✅ Reflect uncertainty
  warn "Service ${service} deployed but health check could not be verified"
fi

cat >"${TMP_RESULTS_DIR}/${service}.json" <<JSON
{
  "status": "${overall_status}"  # ✅ Use actual status
}
JSON
```

### Prevention Measures

1. **Mandatory Health Validation**: Make health checks non-optional for production deployments
2. **Fail-Fast Logic**: Default to failure unless explicitly verified healthy
3. **Integration Tests for Scripts**: Test deployment script with mock failures
4. **Status Verification**: Add assertions that status matches actual deployment outcome
5. **Monitoring Alerts**: Alert on deployment script reporting success but services unhealthy

## Root Cause #4: API Gateway Configuration Issues

### Problem Statement

After successfully deploying all 8 services, API Gateway deployment failed with multiple configuration errors and routing problems.

### Root Cause

Three distinct configuration issues:

**Issue 4.1: OpenAPI Version Mismatch**
- Gateway spec used OpenAPI 3.0 format
- Google Cloud API Gateway requires Swagger 2.0 format
- Deployment failed schema validation

**Issue 4.2: Variable Placeholders in Backend URLs**
- Backend URLs contained environment variables: `https://${SERVICE_URL}/endpoint`
- API Gateway doesn't support variable substitution
- Routing failed with 404 errors

**Issue 4.3: OAuth Endpoint Misconfiguration**
- Security definitions referenced non-existent OAuth domain: `auth.headhunter.ai`
- DNS lookup failed (NXDOMAIN)
- Authentication flow would have failed

### Technical Analysis

**Issue 4.1 Analysis**:
```yaml
# OpenAPI 3.0 (not supported)
openapi: 3.0.0
components:
  schemas:
    SearchRequest: { ... }

# Swagger 2.0 (required)
swagger: "2.0"
definitions:
  SearchRequest: { ... }
```

**Issue 4.2 Analysis**:
```yaml
# Incorrect - variables not resolved
paths:
  /v1/search/hybrid:
    x-google-backend:
      address: https://${HH_SEARCH_SVC_URL}/v1/search/hybrid  # ❌

# Correct - fully qualified URLs
paths:
  /v1/search/hybrid:
    x-google-backend:
      address: https://hh-search-svc-production-akcoqbr7sa-uc.a.run.app/v1/search/hybrid  # ✅
```

**Issue 4.3 Analysis**:
```json
// Incorrect OAuth configuration
{
  "token_uri": "https://auth.headhunter.ai/oauth/token"  // ❌ DNS NXDOMAIN
}

// Correct (production uses AUTH_MODE=none)
// OAuth deferred to future authentication enhancement
```

### Contributing Factors

1. **Documentation Gap**: Insufficient understanding of API Gateway requirements
2. **Template Reuse**: Used OpenAPI 3.0 template without validating compatibility
3. **Environment Abstraction**: Over-relied on variable substitution
4. **Infrastructure Changes**: OAuth domain not provisioned before deployment
5. **Limited Testing**: Gateway configuration not tested before production deployment

### Impact

- **Duration**: 8-12 hours for full gateway resolution
- **Severity**: High - prevented external API access
- **Business Impact**: Backend services operational but not accessible via gateway
- **Workaround Required**: Initially used direct Cloud Run URLs for testing

### Resolution

**Resolution 4.1: Swagger 2.0 Conversion**
- Converted entire OpenAPI spec from 3.0 to 2.0 format
- Changed `components` to `definitions`
- Updated schema references and response formats
- Commit: `695e3a6` - "fix(gateway): enforce Swagger 2.0 compliance"

**Resolution 4.2: URL Resolution**
- Replaced all `${VARIABLE}` placeholders with actual Cloud Run URLs
- Used `gcloud run services describe` to get service URLs
- Updated all backend address fields
- Commits: `55d83dd`, `914fe42` - Gateway URL fixes

**Resolution 4.3: Authentication Bypass**
- Implemented `AUTH_MODE=none` for initial production deployment
- Deferred OAuth integration to future phase
- Documented security implications and remediation plan

### Prevention Measures

1. **Gateway Spec Validation**: Add automated validation against Swagger 2.0 schema
2. **URL Resolution Script**: Create script to automatically populate backend URLs
3. **Pre-Deployment Testing**: Test gateway configuration in staging environment
4. **Documentation**: Document API Gateway requirements in deployment guide
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Deploy gateway incrementally, validate routing per service

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### Issue: Lack of Comprehensive Integration Testing

**Problem**: Each component was tested in isolation but not as a complete system

**Contributing Factors**:
- No staging environment matching production
- Integration tests skipped (SKIP_JEST=1 flag used)
- Docker Compose testing didn't catch Cloud Run-specific issues

**Resolution**:
- Implement full integration test suite
- Create staging environment mirroring production
- Remove SKIP_JEST workarounds

### Issue: Insufficient Documentation

**Problem**: Deployment procedures, endpoint ownership, and configuration requirements poorly documented

**Contributing Factors**:
- Rapid development without documentation updates
- Knowledge siloed with original developers
- Handoff documentation incomplete

**Resolution**:
- Created comprehensive HANDOVER.md
- Documented all deployment procedures
- Added architecture diagrams and dependency graphs

---

## Systemic Improvements Implemented
