## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Local Processing (Ollama) ‚Üê‚Üí Cloud Storage (Firebase) ‚Üê‚Üí Web/Mobile Apps
```

1. **Stage 1**: Pre-processing (Raw files ‚Üí Structured JSON)
2. **Stage 2**: Analysis (JSON + Local LLM ‚Üí Enhanced Profile) 
3. **Stage 3**: Embeddings (Enhanced Profile ‚Üí Vector Database)

### Key Design Decisions
- **Local AI Processing Preserved**: All LLM analysis remains on local machines
- **Cloud Storage Only**: Firebase used for data persistence and APIs
- **Multi-Tenant**: Organization-based data isolation
- **Real-Time**: Live updates and collaboration features
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle thousands of candidates and jobs

## üíª Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (TypeScript/Node.js)
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL document database)
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Frontend**: React (existing UI integration)
- **Local Processing**: Ollama + Llama 3.1 8b (unchanged)

### API Endpoints Summary
- **Candidates**: 8 endpoints (CRUD + search + bulk operations)
- **Jobs**: 8 endpoints (CRUD + search + matching)
- **Files**: 6 endpoints (upload + processing + management)
- **Search**: 4 endpoints (semantic + traditional + analytics)
- **System**: 4 endpoints (health + monitoring + stats)

### Database Collections
- **candidates/**: 29,138+ candidate profiles with analysis
- **jobs/**: Job postings with matching criteria
- **users/**: User accounts with permissions
- **organizations/**: Multi-tenant organization data
- **embeddings/**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **processing_queue/**: Async processing management

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Maintains Current Workflow
1. **Resume Upload**: Now via cloud with progress tracking
2. **Text Extraction**: Enhanced with multiple format support
3. **LLM Analysis**: Unchanged - still 100% local with Ollama
4. **Results Storage**: Now in cloud for collaboration
5. **Search & Discovery**: Enhanced with vector search

### Processing Pipeline Integration
```javascript
// Webhook from cloud to local system
POST /webhook/process-candidate
{
  "candidate_id": "12345",
  "resume_text": "...",
  "callback_url": "https://cloud-function-url/receiveAnalysis"
}

// Local system processes with Ollama (unchanged)
// Results sent back to cloud
POST /receiveAnalysis
{
  "candidate_id": "12345",
  "analysis_results": { /* complete analysis */ }
}
```
