# Database Migration Report

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Cloud SQL Instance:** `sql-hh-core` (headhunter-ai-0088:us-central1)
**Database:** `headhunter`
**Operator:** Claude Code (implementation-specialist)

## Objective

Run database migrations to create required schemas for Headhunter microservices that were connecting to Cloud SQL but missing schema definitions.

## Critical Issue Resolved

**Original Problem:**
- `hh-embed-svc` was connecting to database successfully but reporting:
  ```
  "Schema search is missing. Run migrations or set ENABLE_AUTO_MIGRATE=true"
  ```
- Services could authenticate to Cloud SQL but lacked necessary database objects

## Migration Process

### 1. Schema Files Created

Created migration SQL files in `/scripts/`:

- **`setup_database_schemas_clean.sql`** - Initial attempt with hh_app ownership
- **`setup_database_schemas_postgres.sql`** - Postgres user with ownership transfer
- **`setup_database_tables_fixed.sql`** - Final working version with proper partitioning
- **`grant_permissions.sql`** - Permission grants for all users

### 2. Infrastructure Setup

- Created Cloud Storage bucket: `gs://headhunter-sql-migrations/`
- Granted Cloud SQL service account access: `p1034162584026-8vaynq@gcp-sa-cloud-sql.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Used `gcloud sql import sql` for safe migration execution

### 3. Schemas Created

Successfully created four schemas in the `headhunter` database:

| Schema | Purpose | Owner |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `search` | Candidate profiles, embeddings, search logs | postgres (granted to hh_app) |
| `taxonomy` | ECO occupation data, relationships | postgres (granted to hh_app) |
| `msgs` | Skill demand, role templates | postgres (granted to hh_app) |
| `ops` | Refresh jobs, pipeline metrics | postgres (granted to hh_app) |

### 4. Tables Created

#### Search Schema Tables:
- `candidate_profiles` - Core candidate data with Portuguese FTS
- `candidate_embeddings` - Vector embeddings (1536-dim) with HNSW index
- `search_logs` - Partitioned logging table (by created_at)
- `search_logs_y2024m01` - Partition for Jan 2024
- `search_logs_y2025m01` - Partition for Jan 2025
- `search_logs_y2025m10` - Partition for Oct 2025

#### Taxonomy Schema Tables:
- `eco_occupation` - Occupation taxonomy
- `eco_relationship` - Occupation relationships with weights

#### Msgs Schema Tables:
- `skill_demand` - Skill demand tracking
- `role_template` - Role templates for matching

#### Ops Schema Tables:
- `refresh_jobs` - Background job tracking
- `pipeline_metrics` - Service metrics

### 5. Key Features Implemented

**Portuguese Full-Text Search:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search.update_candidate_search_document()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.search_document := to_tsvector('portuguese',
        COALESCE(NEW.full_name, '') || ' ' || COALESCE(NEW.headline, ''));
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**HNSW Vector Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX candidate_embeddings_hnsw
    ON search.candidate_embeddings USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
    WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

**Partitioned Logging:**
- `search_logs` partitioned by `created_at` (RANGE)
- Primary key includes partition key: `(id, created_at)`

### 6. Permissions Granted

Granted to **hh_app** (application user):
- USAGE on all four schemas
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on all tables
- USAGE, SELECT on all sequences
- CONNECT to headhunter database

Granted to **hh_analytics** (read-only):
- CONNECT to headhunter database
- USAGE on search schema
- SELECT on all search schema tables

Granted to **hh_ops** (operations):
- Full access to all schemas and tables
- Sequence access for auto-increment columns

## Verification

### Service Health Checks

**hh-embed-svc-production:**
- Revision: `hh-embed-svc-production-00054-xqh`
- Status: âœ… **Fully Initialized**
- Logs:
  ```json
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"hh-embed-svc fully initialized and ready"}
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"Embeddings service initialized"}
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"pgvector client initialized"}
  ```

**hh-search-svc-production:**
- Revision: `hh-search-svc-production-00059-ctl`
- Status: âœ… **Fully Initialized**
- Logs:
  ```json
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"hh-search-svc fully initialized and ready"}
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"Search service initialized"}
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"pgvector client initialized"}
  {"level":30,"module":"bootstrap","msg":"Redis client initialized"}
  ```

### No Schema Errors

Both services successfully initialized without any "Schema search is missing" errors or migration warnings.

## Migration Files Artifacts

All migration files stored in:
- **Local:** `/Volumes/Extreme Pro/myprojects/headhunter/scripts/`
- **Cloud Storage:** `gs://headhunter-sql-migrations/`

Key files:
1. `setup_database_tables_fixed.sql` - Final table creation script
2. `grant_permissions.sql` - Permission grants
3. `verify_migration_simple.sql` - Verification queries

## Database Users

| User | Purpose | Password Secret |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| postgres | Superuser (migrations only) | db-primary-password |
| hh_app | Application user | db-operations-password |
| hh_admin | Administrative operations | db-primary-password |
| hh_analytics | Read-only analytics | db-analytics-password |
| hh_ops | Operations/maintenance | db-operations-password |

## Issues Resolved

1. **Partitioning Error:** Fixed `search_logs` PRIMARY KEY to include partition key `created_at`
2. **Ownership:** Schemas created as postgres, permissions granted to hh_app
3. **Extension:** pgvector extension already existed, skipped duplicate creation
4. **Service Initialization:** Services now start without schema validation errors

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Services are healthy and operational
2. âœ… Database schemas fully deployed
3. âœ… Permissions properly configured
4. ðŸ”„ Monitor service logs for any runtime issues
5. ðŸ”„ Consider adding more partitions for `search_logs` as needed

## Production Readiness

All database migrations have been successfully applied. Services are:
- âœ… Connecting to Cloud SQL
- âœ… Validating schema existence
- âœ… Initializing pgvector client
- âœ… Initializing Redis client
- âœ… Passing health checks

**Migration Status: COMPLETE**
