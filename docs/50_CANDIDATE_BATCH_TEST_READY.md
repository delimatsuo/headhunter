## 🚀 How to Execute 50-Candidate Batch Test

### Option 1: Performance Test Suite (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the comprehensive performance test with 50 candidates
python3 scripts/performance_test_suite.py

# This will test:
# - 50 candidates via Together AI processing
# - 25 candidates for embedding generation
# - 10 candidates for end-to-end workflow validation
```

**Expected Results (Based on Validation)**:
- Total Processing Time: ~3-4 minutes
- Success Rate: >99%
- Total Cost: <$0.10
- Output: Detailed performance report + JSON files

### Option 2: Direct API Validation

```bash
# Quick API connectivity test
python3 scripts/api_key_validation.py

# PRD-compliant workflow test
python3 scripts/prd_compliant_validation.py
```

### Option 3: Custom Batch Size

If you want to test exactly 50 candidates with Together AI:

```python
# Custom script or modify performance_test_suite.py line 549:
candidates = self.generate_test_candidates(50)  # Already set to 50!
```

## 📊 Expected Performance Metrics

Based on 110-candidate validation:

| Metric | Expected Value | Confidence |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Success Rate | >99% | High |
