She demonstrated deep system design knowledge and gave thoughtful answers about scaling challenges. Leadership experience is impressive - her team has 95% retention rate which is exceptional. She's clearly invested in developing others. Some concerns about culture fit - she's used to big tech environments and our startup culture might be different. However, she asked great questions about our growth trajectory and seemed genuinely excited about the opportunity. Technical assessment was excellent - solved complex problems efficiently and explained her thought process clearly. Would recommend moving forward with team interviews."
