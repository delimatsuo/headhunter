"""
PRD-Compliant Prompt Builder for Together AI Single-Pass Enrichment

Creates PII-minimizing prompts that return structured JSON matching
the PRD requirements (lines 61-72) for candidate enrichment.

Key principles:
- Use minimal PII necessary for analysis
- Focus on skills, roles, and companies (less sensitive than personal details)
- Single-pass enrichment returning complete PRD structure
- Clear JSON schema guidance for reliable parsing

TASK: Analyze this candidate profile and return a comprehensive assessment in JSON format.

===== CANDIDATE DATA =====

NAME: {name}

EXPERIENCE:
{experience}

EDUCATION:
{education}

RECRUITER COMMENTS:
{comments_text if comments_text else "No comments available"}

===== ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS =====

Perform a comprehensive single-pass analysis covering:

1. Personal Details: Extract basic career information (seniority level, years of experience, location)
2. Education Analysis: Evaluate educational background quality and relevance
3. Experience Analysis: Assess career progression and company tier
4. Technical Assessment: Identify primary skills and expertise level
5. Market Insights: Estimate salary range, market demand, placement difficulty
6. Cultural Assessment: Evaluate strengths, potential concerns, ideal fit
7. Executive Summary: Create concise value proposition for hiring managers
8. Skill Inference: Separate EXPLICIT skills (100% confidence) from INFERRED skills (0-100% confidence)

===== SKILL INFERENCE GUIDELINES =====

EXPLICIT SKILLS (confidence=100):
- Skills directly mentioned in experience or education
- Technologies explicitly listed
- Certifications or tools specifically named
- Evidence: Quote the exact text showing the skill

INFERRED SKILLS (confidence 0-100):
- Skills likely based on role, company, or industry context
- Technologies typically required for positions held
- Competencies implied by seniority and responsibilities

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 90-100: Extremely likely (e.g., "Senior ML Engineer at Meta" â†’ PyTorch)
- 75-89: Highly probable (typical for role/company)
- 60-74: Likely (common for career level/domain)
- 40-59: Possible (could have based on context)
- 0-39: Uncertain (insufficient evidence)

EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Explicit skills: Quote specific text from profile
- Inferred skills: Explain reasoning (e.g., "Meta uses PyTorch extensively")

===== RETURN FORMAT =====

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks) with this EXACT structure:

===== CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS =====

1. Return ONLY the JSON object (no explanations, no markdown)
2. Use the exact field names shown above
3. Provide confidence scores for ALL inferred skills
4. Include evidence and reasoning for skill assessments
5. analysis_confidence should reflect data quality (0.0=very low, 1.0=very high)
6. Set analysis_confidence < 0.5 for sparse profiles (low_content demotion)

===== EXAMPLES =====

Example 1 - High Confidence Inference:
- Role: "Senior ML Engineer at Meta (2020-2023)"
- Inferred: {{"skill": "PyTorch", "confidence": 95, "reasoning": "Meta's primary ML framework"}}

Example 2 - Medium Confidence Inference:
- Role: "Lead Backend Engineer at Nubank"
- Inferred: {{"skill": "Scala", "confidence": 85, "reasoning": "Nubank's primary backend language"}}

Example 3 - Low Confidence Inference:
- Role: "Software Engineer at Startup"
- Inferred: {{"skill": "Agile", "confidence": 60, "reasoning": "Common in startup environments"}}
