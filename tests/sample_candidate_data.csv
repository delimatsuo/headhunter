His work at Netflix on recommendation systems is directly relevant. The scale he's operated at (200M users) far exceeds our current needs, which gives confidence he can handle our growth.

Leadership style seems collaborative - gave specific examples of mentoring and cross-team projects. His team at Uber delivered consistently while maintaining high engineering standards.

Only potential concern is compensation expectations - he's coming from FAANG and we may be at the lower end of his range. However, he expressed interest in our mission and startup environment.

Technical deep-dive was impressive. Drew out system architecture on the whiteboard and identified potential bottlenecks we hadn't considered. This person could immediately contribute to our technical strategy.

Strong hire recommendation."

BA Art History - UCLA (2014)

Technical Skills:
Frontend: React, Vue.js, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Design Systems
Backend: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Tools: Git, Docker, AWS, Figma

Personal:
Art background brings unique perspective to product development. Volunteer teach coding workshops for underrepresented groups.","Mixed feelings about Lisa's interview. She has solid mid-level skills and good experience at well-known companies, but some concerns came up.

Strengths:
- Strong portfolio of work, especially the artist dashboard at Spotify
- Good collaboration skills with design teams
- The art background gives her a unique perspective on UX/UI
- Performance optimization work shows technical depth
- Mentoring experience demonstrates leadership potential

Concerns:
- Job hopping pattern - 4 companies in 6 years
- When asked about challenges, tended to blame external factors rather than taking ownership
- Some gaps in backend knowledge for our stack
- Seemed more interested in frontend/design work than full-stack role

Technical assessment was decent but not exceptional. Solved problems correctly but took longer than expected on algorithm questions.

The non-traditional background (art history + bootcamp) isn't necessarily negative, but combined with the job pattern makes me question long-term commitment.

She's asking for senior-level compensation but experience feels more solid mid-level. Would need to see growth into technical leadership for that salary range.

Maybe hire with focus on frontend/UX work initially and see how she develops. Team should meet her to assess culture fit."
