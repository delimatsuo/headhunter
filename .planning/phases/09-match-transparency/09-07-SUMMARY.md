# 09-07 Summary: Phase 9 Verification

**Plan:** 09-07
**Type:** Verification checkpoint
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Date:** 2026-01-25

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: TypeScript Compilation Check
- **headhunter-ui**: `npm run build` - SUCCESS (283.3 kB JS, 9.42 kB CSS)
- **hh-search-svc**: `npm run build` - SUCCESS
- **hh-rerank-svc**: `npm run build` - SUCCESS

All three builds pass without errors.

## Phase 9 Deliverables Verified

| Requirement | Component | Status |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| TRNS-01: Match score visible | SkillAwareCandidateCard (existing + signal breakdown) | COMPLETE |
| TRNS-02: Component scores shown | SignalScoreBreakdown (12 signals as bars) | COMPLETE |
| TRNS-03: LLM rationale for top candidates | MatchRationale + generateMatchRationale | COMPLETE |
| TRNS-04: Inferred skills with confidence | SkillChip (High/Likely/Possible badges) | COMPLETE |

## Success Criteria Met

1. **Search results UI shows overall match score (0-100)** - Score badge visible on each card
2. **Expandable score breakdown shows individual signal scores** - Toggle button reveals 12 signal bars
3. **Top 10 candidates have LLM-generated rationale** - "Why This Candidate Matches" section
4. **Inferred skills appear with confidence badges** - High (>=0.8), Medium (0.5-0.8), Low (<0.5)
5. **Recruiters can sort/filter by individual signal scores** - Sort dropdown + filter slider with localStorage persistence

## Phase 9 Commit Summary

| Plan | Commits | Key Changes |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 09-01 | 4 | SignalScores types, SignalScoreBreakdown component, API integration |
| 09-02 | 2 | SkillChip component with confidence badges |
| 09-03 | 2 | Card integration (signal breakdown + SkillChip) |
| 09-04 | 4 | Sort/filter controls with localStorage persistence |
| 09-05 | 4 | Backend rationale generation with Redis caching |
| 09-06 | 5 | Frontend rationale display, API wiring |
| 09-07 | 0 | Verification (no code changes) |

**Total Phase 9 commits:** 21

## Technical Notes

- **SignalScoreBreakdown**: Renders 12 signals as horizontal progress bars with color coding
- **SkillChip**: Confidence badges for inferred skills (High/Likely/Possible)
- **Sort/filter controls**: localStorage persistence with `hh_search_` prefix
- **LLM rationale**: Generated by Together AI, cached in Redis with 24h TTL
- **Frontend types**: SignalScores, SignalWeightConfig, MatchRationale mirror backend exactly

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Plan |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Signal breakdown collapsed by default | Progressive disclosure - reduces clutter | 09-01 |
| Confidence thresholds: 0.8/0.5 | High >= 0.8, Medium 0.5-0.79, Low < 0.5 per research | 09-02 |
| Sort persistence in localStorage | UX preference - recruiters don't re-set each session | 09-04 |
| Rationale for top 10 only | Cost optimization - recruiters rarely look past top 10 | 09-05 |
