# Headhunter v2.0 - Integration Gaps & Testing Readiness

## PRD Update: Critical Missing Components for End-to-End Testing

**Date**: September 11, 2025  
**Status**: Integration Phase - Ready for End-to-End Testing  
**Context**: All core components implemented, missing critical integrations

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Together AI Processing**: Complete batch processors with recruiter-grade prompts
- **Cloud Functions API Layer**: CRUD, vector search, embeddings, file upload pipeline
- **React UI Application**: Job description input, candidate results, authentication, search
- **Firebase Integration**: Firestore, authentication, hosting, Cloud Functions
- **Cloud SQL pgvector**: Database schema, Python client, deployment automation, migration tools

### ❌ CRITICAL INTEGRATION GAPS

## Gap 1: pgvector Integration with Vector Search API

**PRD Reference**: Lines 38, 141, 143  
**Current State**: `vector-search.ts` uses Firestore embeddings  
**Required State**: Use Cloud SQL pgvector for high-performance semantic search  

**Impact**: Vector search not using optimized pgvector backend - performance and cost issues

**Technical Requirements**:
- Replace Firestore-based vector search in `functions/src/vector-search.ts`
- Integrate with `scripts/pgvector_store.py` Python client
- Implement Node.js pgvector client or create REST API bridge
- Maintain existing API contracts for frontend compatibility
- Add connection pooling and error handling

## Gap 2: Skill Probability Assessment

**PRD Reference**: Lines 47, 51-52 (implied from "technical_assessment" and search optimization)  
**User Requirement**: Explicit skill extraction with confidence scores  
**Current State**: Basic skill extraction without probability scoring  

**Impact**: Cannot test skill-based matching accuracy or recruiter confidence in recommendations

**Technical Requirements**:
- Modify Together AI prompts to include skill confidence scoring
- Add explicit vs inferred skill classification
- Include probability weighting in candidate profiles
- Update frontend to display skill confidence levels
- Enhance search ranking algorithm to use skill probabilities

## Gap 3: End-to-End Integration Testing

**PRD Reference**: Lines 19-21, 87-88 (recruiter workflow)  
**Current State**: Components exist but integration status unknown  
**Required State**: Verified end-to-end recruiter workflows  

**Impact**: Cannot guarantee production readiness for recruiter testing

**Technical Requirements**:
- Verify Job Description → Candidate Recommendations workflow
- Test Resume Upload → Similar Candidate Search workflow  
- Validate authentication and CRUD operations
- Confirm embedding generation and search integration
- Test "Why they're a match" rationale generation

## Gap 4: Enhanced Profile Generation with Skill Assessment

**PRD Reference**: Lines 43-52 (AI-Generated Candidate Profiles)  
**User Requirement**: Enhanced profiles with skill probability for testing  
**Current State**: Basic profile generation  

**Impact**: Cannot demonstrate full profile enhancement capabilities to recruiters

**Technical Requirements**:
- Enhanced `technical_assessment` with skill confidence scores
- Improved `market_insights` with skill-based market positioning
- Skills-aware `executive_summary` with confidence-weighted recommendations
- Skill gap analysis for candidate positioning

## New Tasks Required

### Task 24: Integrate pgvector with Vector Search API
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Dependencies**: Task 23 (Cloud SQL pgvector setup)  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Deliverables**:
- Updated `functions/src/vector-search.ts` using pgvector
- Node.js pgvector client or REST API bridge
- Maintained API compatibility
- Performance benchmarking vs current Firestore implementation

### Task 25: Implement Skill Probability Assessment
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Task 14 (Recruiter-Grade Prompts)  
**Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Deliverables**:
- Enhanced Together AI prompts with skill confidence
- Updated candidate profile schema with skill probabilities
- Frontend components displaying skill confidence
- Skill-aware search ranking algorithm

### Task 26: End-to-End Integration Testing
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 24, 25  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Deliverables**:
- Complete recruiter workflow validation
- Integration test suite for all components
- Performance and accuracy benchmarks
- User acceptance testing checklist

### Task 27: Enhanced Profile Demonstration
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Dependencies**: Task 25  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Deliverables**:
- Sample enhanced profiles with skill assessment
- Demonstration dataset for recruiter testing
- Profile quality metrics and validation
- Documentation for recruiter onboarding

- **User Experience**: Complex skill confidence UI may confuse recruiters

### Medium Risk  
- **Performance at Scale**: pgvector performance with 29k+ candidates untested
- **API Rate Limits**: Together AI usage may hit limits during testing
- **Data Migration**: Moving from Firestore to pgvector requires careful validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Rollout**: Test with small candidate subset initially
- **Parallel Systems**: Keep Firestore backup during transition
- **User Training**: Provide clear documentation for skill confidence interpretation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for system degradation
