Invalid Cloud Run annotation - autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale was incorrectly applied to Service resource instead of Revision template\n2. Container PORT=8080 configuration issues - Fastify services not binding to correct port\n3. OAuth endpoint misconfiguration - token_uri pointing to non-existent auth.headhunter.ai domain instead of correct idp.production.ella.jobs\n4. API Gateway deployment blocked - prerequisite services never achieved healthy state, preventing gateway deployment\n\nRoot cause: Deployment script reported success based on submission rather than actual service health validation. All 8 services (admin, enrich, search, msgs, vector, eco, embeddings, rerank) are non-functional in production.\n\nIMMEDIATE IMPACT:\n- Zero production API availability\n- All tenant operations blocked\n- Search and enrichment pipelines offline\n- OAuth authentication broken\n\nThis task requires immediate remediation to restore production services and complete the Phase 5-7 deployment objectives.",

Resolve Fastify PORT binding issues\n   - Audit all 8 service Dockerfiles for PORT environment variable\n   - Ensure Fastify.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080, '0.0.0.0')\n   - Verify Cloud Run PORT injection works correctly\n\n3. Correct OAuth endpoint configuration\n   - Update Secret Manager secret for OAuth credentials\n   - Change token_uri from https://auth.headhunter.ai/oauth2/token to https://idp.production.ella.jobs/oauth2/token\n   - Verify domain routing and certificate validity\n\n4. Fix deployment health validation\n   - Modify deployment script to poll actual service health endpoints\n   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n   - Fail deployment if services don't reach healthy state within timeout\n\n5. Execute phased service redeployment\n   - Deploy foundational services first (admin, enrich)\n   - Validate health before proceeding to dependent services\n   - Deploy remaining services (search, msgs, vector, eco, embeddings, rerank)\n   - Confirm all 8 services report healthy status\n\n6. Deploy API Gateway after service mesh is healthy\n   - Verify all backend service URLs are reachable\n   - Configure gateway routes to point to healthy services\n   - Test gateway routing to all 8 services\n\n7. Update deployment documentation\n   - Correct deployment report to reflect actual state (not planned)\n   - Document root causes and remediation steps\n   - Add validation checklist to prevent recurrence\n\n8. Production validation and smoke testing\n   - Test authentication flow end-to-end\n   - Verify each service endpoint responds correctly\n   - Run load tests to confirm stability\n   - Monitor for errors in first 24 hours\n\nDEPENDENCIES:\n- Access to GCP console for Cloud Run\n- Secret Manager write permissions for OAuth fix\n- Deployment script modification rights\n\nBLOCKING:\n- All production API operations\n- Phase 6 and Phase 7 objectives",
