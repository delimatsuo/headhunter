# Task ID: 26
# Title: End-to-End Integration Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22, 24, 25, 12, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Validate complete recruiter workflows including Job Description to Candidate Recommendations, Resume Upload to Similar Candidate Search, authentication and CRUD operations. Test embedding generation and search integration.
# Details:
Create comprehensive integration testing framework for production readiness:

1. **Test Framework Setup**:
   - Create `tests/integration/` directory structure
   - Set up pytest-asyncio for async test support
   - Configure test fixtures for database seeding and cleanup
   - Implement test data factory for realistic candidate profiles
   - Create mock services for external API dependencies
   - Set up test coverage reporting with pytest-cov
   - Configure parallel test execution for speed

2. **Workflow Test Suites**:
   - **Job Description to Recommendations** (test_job_to_candidates.py):
     * Test job description parsing and skill extraction
     * Verify embedding generation for job requirements
     * Test pgvector similarity search for candidate matching
     * Validate ranking algorithm with skill probabilities
     * Assert recommendation quality metrics
   - **Resume Upload to Similar Search** (test_resume_similarity.py):
     * Test multi-format resume upload (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
     * Verify Together AI processing pipeline
     * Test embedding generation and storage
     * Validate similar candidate retrieval
     * Assert search result relevance

3. **Authentication & Security Tests** (test_auth_integration.py):
   - Test Firebase Authentication flow end-to-end
   - Verify JWT token validation across services
   - Test role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Validate API rate limiting
   - Test CORS configuration
   - Verify data isolation between tenants

4. **CRUD Operations Testing** (test_crud_operations.py):
   - Test candidate profile creation with Together AI enrichment
   - Verify profile update operations and version control
   - Test bulk operations performance
   - Validate cascade delete operations
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios
   - Verify Firestore and pgvector synchronization

5. **Embedding & Search Integration** (test_vector_search.py):
   - Test VertexAI embedding generation pipeline
   - Verify pgvector storage and indexing
   - Test semantic search accuracy
   - Validate hybrid search (keyword + vector)
   - Test search result pagination
   - Verify search performance under load

6. **Production Readiness Validation**:
   - **Performance Testing** (test_performance.py):
     * Load test with 1000+ concurrent users
     * Stress test API endpoints
     * Measure response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
     * Test database connection pooling
   - **Reliability Testing** (test_reliability.py):
     * Test circuit breaker activation
     * Verify retry logic with transient failures
     * Test graceful degradation
     * Validate error recovery mechanisms
   - **Data Consistency** (test_consistency.py):
     * Test eventual consistency between stores
     * Verify transaction atomicity
     * Test concurrent update handling
     * Validate data integrity constraints

7. **Test Automation & CI/CD**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for integration tests
   - Set up test environment provisioning scripts
   - Implement test result reporting to dashboard
   - Configure automatic rollback on test failure
   - Create smoke test suite for production deployments

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive validation approach:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Provision isolated test GCP project
   - Deploy test instances of all services
   - Seed test database with 500+ candidate profiles
   - Configure test API keys and credentials

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Run tests in parallel with pytest-xdist
   - Execute smoke tests first (5 min)
   - Run full integration suite (30 min)
   - Perform load testing (15 min)
   - Generate coverage report (target: >80%)

3. **Validation Criteria**:
   - All critical paths must pass 100%
   - API response times < 500ms p95
   - Search relevance score > 0.85
   - Zero data consistency errors
   - No memory leaks over 1-hour run
   - Error rate < 0.1%

4. **Monitoring & Reporting**:
   - Real-time test execution dashboard
   - Automated failure notifications
   - Performance regression detection
   - Test flakiness tracking
   - Historical trend analysis
