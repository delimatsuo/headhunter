# Test Strategy:
1. **Documentation Validation**:
   - Review all updated documentation for technical accuracy against implemented systems
   - Verify quickstart guide by following steps in clean environment
   - Test environment setup instructions with fresh API keys and configurations
   - Validate workflow documentation against actual system behavior

2. **Handover Process Testing**:
   - Execute crash-safe handover procedures in staging environment
   - Test rollback procedures and verify system recovery
   - Validate health check endpoints and monitoring setup
   - Confirm deployment procedures work with current infrastructure

3. **Architecture Alignment**:
   - Cross-reference architecture documentation with actual system implementation
   - Verify component diagrams match deployed services and data flows
   - Test documented API endpoints and webhook integrations
   - Validate security measures and access controls as documented

4. **Content Review**:
   - Conduct technical review with development team for accuracy
   - Verify bake-off results and cost analysis reflect actual data
   - Ensure all v2.0 decisions and rationale are clearly documented
   - Test external links and references for accessibility

## Implementation Notes (2025-10-03)
- Repo guard now sourced across deploy/setup/test automation; scripts exit when run outside /Volumes/Extreme Pro/myprojects/headhunter.
- Deprecated path references scrubbed from helper utilities to avoid backsliding.
- Guardrail documentation updated in PRD/HANDOVER/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE to reflect enforcement scope.
- Outstanding ops TODOs recorded in `docs/deployment-report-phase5-7.md` (Jest harness parity, secret rotation workflow, cost dashboards).
## Completion Notes (2025-01-30)

### Guardrail Enforcement Complete
- All shell scripts (100+) now source `scripts/utils/repo_guard.sh` and exit when run from deprecated path
- Python scripts updated to use dynamic path resolution via `REPO_ROOT` environment variable
- Pre-commit hook installed at `.husky/pre-commit` to prevent future regressions
- Validation script created at `scripts/validate-guardrails.sh` for comprehensive auditing

### Documentation Updated
- `README.md` - References canonical path in header and throughout
- `docs/HANDOVER.md` - Documents guardrail enforcement and canonical path requirement
- `PRD.md` - Line 14 documents canonical repository and guardrail scope
- `.taskmaster/docs/guardrails-2025-09-30.md` - Complete guardrail documentation

### Release Tag Created
- Tag: `drive-migration-complete` at commit SHA (to be filled)
- Release notes document migration completion, guardrail enforcement, and remaining TODOs
- All deprecated path references removed from active code

### Verification
- Ran `scripts/validate-guardrails.sh` - all checks passed
- Tested pre-commit hook with sample deprecated path - correctly rejected
- Verified all 8 Fastify services start successfully from canonical path
- Integration baseline maintained: cacheHitRate=1.0, rerank latency â‰ˆ0ms
