# Headhunter v2.0 - AI-Powered Recruitment Analytics Platform

## Overview  
Headhunter v2.0 transforms Ella Executive Search's candidate database into an intelligent, semantic search engine powered by **cloud-based AI processing and vector embeddings**. It solves the inefficiency of keyword-based ATS queries by deeply analyzing 20,000+ candidates using Together AI's Llama 3.2 3B model, creating comprehensive profiles with 15+ detailed fields, and enabling semantic similarity search for recruiter workflows.

**Core Value Proposition**: Recruiters can upload job descriptions and instantly find the most relevant candidates from a database of enhanced profiles with semantic understanding, reducing time-to-longlist from hours to minutes while uncovering hidden matches that keyword search would miss.
